# Assignment 1

The data for this exercise was kindly supplied by J. Louter (INT/ILC) and was derived from an experiment in which adult C.elegans nematodes were exposed to varying concentrations of different compounds. The variables RawData (the outcome - number of offspring counted as an integer value, after incubation time), compName (the generic name of the compound/chemical), the compConcentration (the concentration of the compound), and the expType are the most important variables in this dataset.

A typical analysis with this data would be to run a dose-response analysis using a log-logistic model with estimates for the maximal, the minimal, the IC50 concentration and the slope at IC50. We will not go into the details but a good package to run such computations and create graphs in R is the {drc} package. See: and:. In the exercise below we will create some visualizations using {ggplot2}.

## a)
Review the following Excel file in the ./data/CE.LIQ.FLOW.062_Tidydata.xlsx (itâ€™s here), by opening the file in Excel. See if you can spot anything peculiar about this file. Do not edit the file in any way. Just close it when you are done. (Annoyingly, Excel asks you to save your changes, even if you did not touch anything in the file.)

### Answer
There are some missing data points in the column "RawData" row 192-196 and there are some rows which have the same value for everything. That could just be in a metadata file instead of a seperate column for everything

## b)
Open the file in R, using the {readxl} package.

### Answer
```{r}
data <- read_excel(here(
  "assignment_1",
  "raw_data",
  "CE.LIQ.FLOW.062_Tidydata.xlsx"
))
```

## c)
Inspect the data types of columns RawData, compName and compConcentration. What types would you expect from the experimental description above. Have the data types been correctly assigned during the importing of the data into R?

### Answer
RawData was already a double, compConcentration was not a double as expected because of the scientific notation introduced by excel during import; This was changed into numeric notation. The compName could easily be changed into a factor which is to be expected in this data set. 

## d)
Create a graph displaying a scatterplot for the CE.LIQ.FLOW.062_Tidydata.xlsx data, for the different compounds and the varying concentrations. Put the compConcentration on the x-axis, the DataRaw counts on the y-axis and assign a colour to each level in compName. Assign a different symbol (shape =) to each level in the expType variable. Try fixing the labels of the x-axis so that we can read them

### Answer
```{r, warning=FALSE}
# create scatterplot graph with unfiltered data
data %>%
  ggplot(aes(x= compConcentration, y= RawData, color= compName, shape= expType)) +
  geom_point()
```

## e)
When creating the plot under d), what happened with the ordering of the x-axis labels. Explain why this happens. Look at the data-type of the compConcentration column in the data again to find a clue.

### Answer

compConcentration is still a character value which will be read as seperate groups instead of numeric values.

## f)
Correct this and than look at the graph again. Use a log10 transformation on the x-axis to get a clear graph. Also, add a bit of jitter to the points in the graph so that points are not overlapping.

### Answer
```{r, warning=FALSE}
# check the unique values in column compConcentration and see that some of the values are in scientific notation which causes the values to be read as character instead of numeric
unique(data$compConcentration)

# change the scientifically notated values in numeric values
data["compConcentration"][data["compConcentration"] == "1.95E-2"] <- "0.0195"
data["compConcentration"][data["compConcentration"] == "4.9899999999999996E-3"] <- "0.0049899999999999996"
data["compConcentration"][data["compConcentration"] == "4.9899999999999999E-4"] <- "0.00049899999999999999"
data["compConcentration"][data["compConcentration"] == "1.9499999999999999E-3"] <- "0.0019499999999999999"
data["compConcentration"][data["compConcentration"] == "4.99E-2"] <- "0.0499"
data["compConcentration"][data["compConcentration"] == "4.99E-5"] <- "0.0000499"
data["compConcentration"][data["compConcentration"] == "1.95E-4"] <- "0.000195"

# change global options to not have scientific notation in as.numeric function
options(scipen=999)

# once again check the unique values; they can now be changed into numeric values
unique(data$compConcentration)
data$compConcentration <- as.numeric(data$compConcentration)

# change column "compName" and "expType" into a factor
data$compName <- as.factor(data$compName)
data$expType <- as.factor(data$expType)

# create scatterplot graph with a bit of jitter so points do not overlap
data %>%
  ggplot(aes(x= compConcentration, y= RawData, color= compName, shape= expType)) +
  geom_jitter(position = position_jitter(0.05)) +
  scale_x_log10(limits=c(0.01,100))
```

## g) & h)
Fill in: (g) The positive control for this experiments is Ethanol. (h) The negative control for this experiment is S-medium

## i)
Think about how you would analyze this experiment to learn whether there is indeed an effect of different concentrations on offspring count and whether the different compounds have a different curve (IC50). Write down your analysis as a step-wise plan.

### Answer


## j)
Normalize the data for the controlNegative in such a way that the mean value for controlNegative is exactly equal to 1 and that all other values are expressed as a fraction thereof. Rerun your graphs with the normalized data.

### Answer
```{r, warning=FALSE}
# get mean of controlNegative in column expType
norm <- data %>% group_by(expType) %>% summarise_at(vars(RawData), list(name=mean))

# create new column with normalized data
norm_data <- data %>% mutate(norm_RawData= RawData / as.numeric(norm[1,2]))

# create normalized scatterplot
norm_data %>%
  ggplot(aes(x= compConcentration, y= norm_RawData, color= compName, shape= expType)) +
  geom_jitter(position = position_jitter(0.05)) +
  scale_x_log10(limits=c(0.01,100))
```

## k)
Why would you want to take the step under J?

### Answer
Om de data te normaliseren, nu wordt gekeken naar de verhoudingen in plaats van de absolute getallen.
